A backend implementation for WebAuthn was created using PHP and MySQL, enabling users to authenticate without the need for passwords. The system supports secure login through biometric devices or hardware security keys, with user credentials securely stored in a MySQL database. This setup follows WebAuthn standards, providing a secure and user-friendly authentication experience.

Additionally, Google Sign-In was integrated to offer an alternative login method through Google accounts. This allows users to authenticate using their Google credentials, enhancing flexibility. The integration uses OAuth 2.0 for a secure and streamlined login process.

Both WebAuthn and Google Sign-In are seamlessly combined, allowing users to choose their preferred authentication method. Credentials and user data are securely stored, ensuring a robust and scalable solution for web applications.
